* A mobile application that serves multiple purposes to the user by creating a personalized interface for every individual by letting them create their own profiles ( signup using the Google APIs ) alerts of deadlines of submissions, also we can add free resources of different Technology which we have used ourselves to help students developing different skills and extra classes will be made available since the students will be able to set up their own personal timetable with the same.  


* Updates of events happening in the college like Electrothon 2.0 ,  workshops, events, and interviews of various clubs and societies, etc. Brochures regarding the same can also be circulated on the app itself.


* As Team SPEC organises different Workshops and Events throughout the year so we can add a feature of Student Registration in the App for each workshop and event and maintain all the data on our database. Also resources used to teach in the workshop can be made available on the App and can take feedback of the workshop too in it. 
We can add contact details of All the Faculty members of ECE Department in the App. So, whenever any student needs the help of any faculty member can get his/her details directly in the App. 


* A live chat feature will let the students talk to the mentors at some specified time as per the schedule. 
Last but not the least, subjective resources like pdfs of notes, books, past year papers, and links to important video lectures will also be provided.

  Goals:
  * Providing students with better access to all the available resources
  * Makes it easier for students to get the right resources to develop different skills of their choice, get help on these from members of Team SPEC, get study material like previous year Notes, Question Papers and pdf of books compiled at one place.
  * Showing all college related updates like Electrothon, Spec-Fest or maybe the day's timetable.
